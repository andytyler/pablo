# State Management

Pablo uses Svelte stores for state management. The main stores are:

## HTML Store
The HTML store manages the state of the design, including the HTML content and artboard dimensions.

Key properties:
- `content` - The HTML content to render
- `artboard_width` - Width of the artboard
- `artboard_height` - Height of the artboard
- `design_json` - The structured JSON representation of the design
- `design_concept` - The design concept generated from the user prompt

## Local Storage
Some components like `VisionChat` use local storage to persist chat history between sessions.
