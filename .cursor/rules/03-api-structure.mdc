# API Structure

Pablo's backend is built with SvelteKit's API routes. The main API endpoints are:

## Design Generation

- [src/routes/api/generate-design/+server.ts](mdc:src/routes/api/generate-design/+server.ts) - Generates HTML designs from text prompts
  - Takes text prompts, current design state, and artboard dimensions
  - Returns structured design data and HTML for rendering

## External Services

Pablo connects to multiple AI services for design generation through the connections library:

- `$lib/connections/design.ts` - Functions for design generation and processing
- `$lib/connections/screenshot.ts` - Functions for capturing screenshots of the current design
